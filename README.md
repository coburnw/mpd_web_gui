Configuration:
`vim ~/.mpdconf`

Example config:
```
# Required files

## What is working
* A very simple three pane music library (artists > albums > songs)
* Play a song with a click on the play arrow
* A status bar showing the current song (refreshes on song play/pause)
* Pause/resume a song from the status bar
* Show song progress
* Socket communication for UI updates 

## What needs to be done
* Implement a playlist
* Show album cover

## In the far far future
* Change loudness of songs
* Play a random song
* Allow more complicated queries (like all songs to a genre)
* Make GUI more mobile friendly
* Implement more metadata like song rating
* Album art downloader with sharpening/resizing/contrast
* Lyrics downloader
